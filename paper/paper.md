# Summary

STITCH is a Python-based framework for linking diverse data sources across geospatial and temporal dimensions to enable contextual enrichment of individual-level observational data. Its primary goal is to facilitate the augmentation of datasets, such as survey, clinical, or cohort data, with spatio-temporal contextual information (e.g., air quality, weather, or neighborhood characteristics), which often are high-dimensional and large. STITCH supports flexible geospatial (e.g., by census tract, ZIP code, or geographic coordinates) and precise time-lagged linkage, allowing researchers to create and align longitudinal contextual data based on the date of the observation (e.g. when the interview was conducted). It also supports the integration of participants’ residential histories, enabling accurate linkage of contextual data to periods of residence and relocation. Designed for local deployment, STITCH provides a scalable, reproducible, and user-friendly solution for high-resolution spatio-temporal data integration, offering both command-line (CLI) and graphical (GUI) interfaces for flexible use across research workflows. 

# Statement of need






# Citations

<!-- Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)" -->

# Figures

<!-- Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% } -->
