# Summary

The HRS Contextual Data Linkage Tool is a Python-based desktop application that simplifies the process of linking HRS respondent data with contextual information from various geographic levels (e.g., census tract, county, state). The tool provides an intuitive graphical user interface that allows researchers to select their HRS dataset, choose contextual data sources, specify geographic identifiers, and perform the linkage with a few clicks. The application handles the complexities of data merging, geographic identifier matching, and data validation, producing a linked dataset ready for analysis. By automating these technical steps, the tool enables researchers to focus on their substantive research questions rather than data management challenges.

# Citations

<!-- Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)" -->

# Figures

<!-- Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% } -->
